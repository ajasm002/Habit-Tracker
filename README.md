# Habit-Tracker
fun project for mini holiday hackacthon
Worked on a habit tracker with teammates (@nyla @SPH) will add future updates work is in progress

Project Description: Our project is a habit tracker website that allows users to track a habit of their choosing, the number of days they've completed/performed the habit, and "level up" their stats like wisdom, strength, defense, and speed like a video game. The Python portion of the project is a database which keeps tracks of the user's past habit tracking entries. When the program is run, an instance of the class User is created. An interactive menu program allows the user to update their current level, create a new entry for their habits of the day, modify the points of past entries, or view their progress report (all entries in the habit tracker). If the user chooses to create a new entry, they are prompted to enter point values for each of their habits; the program automatically records the date of when the entry is made. Only one entry can be saved in the database per day.
